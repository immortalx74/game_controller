# game_controller
 
### Game controller library for [LÃ–VR](https://lovr.org/) 

### General use notes:
First require the library: `local gc = require "game_controller"`

On `lovr.load` call `getDeviceCount` to get the number of connected devices at the time the application starts.

Ideally, you should also store each device's unique identifier at this point, by calling `getDeviceGUID`. This will be useful later because the index (jid) passed into various functions of the lib isn't guaranteed to be the same between different runs of your app, or if a device was connected/disconnected.

The idea is that you can check against your stored GUIDs to correctly identify a specific device.

Another option is to call `getDeviceName` but this also isn't guaranteed to be unique. There are cases where some generic gamepads are simply just called "USB Device".

You can check if a device was connected/disconnected at runtime by querying `configurationChanged`.

There's a database of known game-controllers maintained by the SDL community.
A version of this file is included with this library, but the latest version can be found in this [link](https://github.com/gabomdq/SDL_GameControllerDB) so that you can replace it anytime.

At the start of the app, the library reads this file to get updated information about these known game-controllers. It is used for mapping buttons/axes of different controllers to a common format. You can query if a connected device is one of these by calling `isDeviceGamepad`, and then call `getGamepadState` to get the state of buttons/axes using named values instead of indices. (See example in the API below)

The rest are mostly polling functions which are self explanatory.

### API:
---
`isDevicePresent( jid )`

#### Checks if the device with the specified index is connected
#### Returns `boolean`, true if connected
---
`getDeviceCount()`

#### Get the number of connected devices
#### Returns `number`
---
`getDeviceName( jid )`

#### Get the name of the device with the specified index
#### Returns `string`
---
`getGamepadName( jid )`

#### Get the name of the gamepad with the specified index (if the device is a gamepad)
#### Returns `string`
NOTE: Always check if the device is a gamepad with `isDeviceGamepad`

---
`getButtonCount( jid )`

#### Get the button count of the device with the specified index
#### Returns `number`
---
`getButtonState( jid, bid )`

#### Get the button state of the device with the specified index
#### returns `number`, 0 (not down) or 1 (down)
---
`getAxesCount( jid )`

#### Get the axes count of the device with the specified index
#### Returns `number`
---
`getAxisValue( jid, aid )`

#### Get the axis value of the device with the specified index
#### Returns `number`, a float with (-1, 1) range
---
`getHatCount( jid )`

#### Get the hat count of the device with the specified index
#### Returns `number`
---
`getHatState( jid, hid )`

#### Get the hat state of the device with the specified index
#### Returns `number`, values are as follows:
- Centered = 0
- Up = 1
- Right = 2
- Down = 4
- Left = 8

#### The other combinations can be retrieved by ORing 2 values. e.g. for Right+Up: `bit.bor( 2, 1 )`
---
`configurationChanged()`

#### Detects if a device was connected/disconnected
#### Returns `boolean`, `string`, `number`,
[1] true if a device was connected/disconnected

[2] string describing the event ("connected" or "disconnected")

[3] index of the device

NOTE: This should normally be called every frame and it will return true only for the particular frame where a change was detected.

---
`getDeviceGUID( jid )`

#### Gets the global unique identifier of a device
#### Returns `string`
---
`getGamepadState( jid )`

#### Get the buttons/axes state of the device with the specified index (if the device is a gamepad)
#### Returns `table`
NOTE: The returned table fields are `buttons` and `axes`
Each field is an array that can be indexed with named values. Example:

`local value = getGamepadState( 1 ).axes[ GAMEPAD_AXIS_LEFT_X ]`
In this case the value of the axis named `GAMEPAD_AXIS_LEFT_X`, for the device with index 1 is returned.

---
`isDeviceGamepad( jid )`

#### Check if the device with the specified index is a gamepad
#### Returns `boolean`
